# RadarBot
**GGF Lab Pre-screening AI**

## Overview

RadarBot is the core repository for **GGF Lab Pre-screening AI**, an AI-driven pre-screening platform designed to accelerate materials and product R&D.

By leveraging early-stage laboratory data, RadarBot predicts the probability of passing industrial standards (e.g., JIS) and long-term durability or degradation behavior *before* running time-consuming and expensive physical tests.

RadarBot enables faster, data-driven decision-making and reduces unnecessary experimental cycles in R&D workflows.

## What is GGF Lab Pre-screening AI?

GGF Lab Pre-screening AI focuses on **lab-to-test prediction**:

- Predict pass/fail probabilities for standardized tests (e.g., corrosion, weathering, durability)
- Identify high-risk conditions at an early research stage
- Optimize material composition, surface treatment, and test conditions
- Reduce cost, time, and trial-and-error in experimental development

This platform is designed to be used **before formal qualification or certification tests**, acting as a decision-support system for researchers and engineers.
